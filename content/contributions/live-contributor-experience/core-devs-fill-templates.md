title: Don’t treat core devs as exceptions to filling out templates
what: >
  Many projects use templates for PRs and Issues to help guide contributions.
  The requirement to fill out these templates should apply to core developers
  as well as external contributors.
why: >
  If your templates are tedious enough that you don’t want to fill them out,
  then your contributors will feel the same. Additionally, the information
  collected from these templates is often useful to readers who encounter the
  PR/Issue later.
when: From the beginning
