Title: Help users and contributors communicate with you
layout: docs/single

As your project grows, youâ€™ll want separate channels for various types of
communication. This allows you to separate different modes of work (e.g., keep
user support separate from feature development). It becomes important to guide
contributors and users to the right place for each communication type.
